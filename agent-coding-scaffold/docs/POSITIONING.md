# Positioning

## Product category

Agent Coding Scaffold is a project-level execution scaffold, not an agent runtime.

## Core positioning

- For teams building with AI agents as first-class contributors
- For projects requiring continuity, traceability, and repeatability
- For workflows that need compact machine context plus human governance

## Design principles

1. Single source of truth, dual surface
   - Canonical project facts live once.
   - Human docs and agent docs are separate views over the same facts.
2. Local-first execution memory
   - Keep short, structured context in-repo.
3. Progressive disclosure
   - Start from index docs, then expand only what is needed.
4. Adapter-based integration
   - Treat external systems as optional connectors.

## Audience

- Individual engineers using agents daily
- Internal platform teams standardizing agent workflows
- Open-source maintainers coordinating multi-session agent contributions
