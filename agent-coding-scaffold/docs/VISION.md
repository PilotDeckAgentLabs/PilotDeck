# Vision

## Long-term aim

Define an open, practical standard for agent-native software engineering.

The standard should let any capable AI agent continue meaningful work across sessions with minimal re-context cost while keeping outputs auditable for humans.

## Success criteria

- Agents can bootstrap into a project in minutes using compact context artifacts.
- Teams can inspect why decisions were made and what changed at each step.
- The scaffold works across stacks and orchestration tools.
- External integrations are optional adapters, not hard dependencies.

## Non-goals

- Not a replacement for application frameworks.
- Not tied to one LLM provider or IDE.
- Not a full telemetry platform.
